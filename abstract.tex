\begin{abstract}
Clustering algorithms are an important concept in machine learning and data science.
We review the formalization of clustering algorithms developed by \textsc{Carlsson} and \textsc{M\'emoli} \cite{Carlsson2010}.
Based on this we present a new uniqueness result for clustering functors. In particular, we show that every surjective \emph{regular} $\gen$ clustering functor is a version of the Vietoris-Rips functor.
Furthermore, this allows us to also state that the Vietoris-Rips functor is the only clustering functor satisfying a modified version \cite[Sec.~7.3.1]{Carlsson2010} of \textsc{Kleinberg}'s impossibility conditions \cite{Kleinberg2002}.
