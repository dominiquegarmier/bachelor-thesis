  title     = {Cambridge studies in advanced mathematics: Basic category theory
               series number 143},
  author    = {Leinster, Tom},
  abstract  = {At the heart of this short introduction to category theory is
               the idea of a universal property, important throughout
               mathematics. After an introductory chapter giving the basic
               definitions, separate chapters explain three ways of expressing
               universal properties: via adjoint functors, representable
               functors, and limits. A final chapter ties all three together.
               The book is suitable for use in courses or for independent
               study. Assuming relatively little mathematical background, it is
               ideal for beginning graduate students or advanced undergraduates
               learning category theory for the first time. For each new
               categorical concept, a generous supply of examples is provided,
               taken from different parts of mathematics. At points where the
               leap in abstraction is particularly great (such as the Yoneda
               lemma), the reader will find careful and extensive explanations.
               Copious exercises are included.},

  abstract  = {It is shown that the computational behaviour of a hierarchical
               sorting-strategy depends on three properties, which are
               established for five conventional strategies and four measures.
               The conventional strategies are shown to be simple variants of a
               single linear system defined by four parameters. A new strategy
               is defined, enabling continuous variation of intensity of
               grouping by variation in a single parameter. An Appendix
               provides specifications of computer programs embodying the new
               principles.},
